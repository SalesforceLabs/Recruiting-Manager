# Recruiting-Manager

Recruiting Manager for AppExchange offers a structured, consolidated way to track and manage the recruiting process, so organizations have easy access to information about openings, applicants, candidates, and hiring goals.

Highlights:
- Manages information about applicants and candidates and how you communicate with them
- Supports referral incentive programs by tracking the candidates that have been referred by employees
- Categorizes job descriptions by department and analyzes results of hiring efforts

Recruiting Manager helps you zero in on the talent you need to run your business without wasting valuable time keeping track of recruiting details. The application allows you to extend your salesforce.com solution to create a single repository of the information you need about each would-be employee. You can even segment early-stage applicants from more promising late-stage candidates to identify who’s moving forward and which positions are likely to be filled soon.

On the Jobs tab you can see the basics about each open position, including its current status and how long it’s been open. Some of your best candidates may be referred by your current employees. So Recruiting Manager lets you easily track referrals in case you want to say “thank you” or provide more formal employee incentives.

Designed for companies with fairly complex hiring needs, Recruiting Manager enables you to get quick answers to questions like “How many positions have been filled this month?” If you’re interested in comparing this with a more basic application designed to help small and medium-sized companies with recruiting, take a look at Recruiting.
